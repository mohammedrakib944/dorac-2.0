                    ticket to this metaverse space. It will play a big role in
                    how you interact with the game and how many things you can

                    doge. Higher REP also means you will be able to buy building
                    upgrades and will determine if you can rent them out to
                    other players. Earning REP by interacting with metaverse,
                    winning in tournaments and races and getting positive

                Initially, the majority of our ecosystem will focus on racing
                dogs in the form of nfts. Dogs will be acquired through our
                pre-sale and main-sale events before launching our platform. You
                will be able to get your hands on them via giveaways and special
                promotional events so be sure to join our socials to get info on
                that. Another way of getting them would be using in game market
                place where you will be able to buy them from other players.
                Later down the road there will be more options added which I
                will not discuss at this time.

                Our dogs will have few main traits on them , color will have

                dogs:
              </p>
              <p className="my-4">
                <span className="text-gray-50 font-bold">Agility</span> – will
                determine your dog’s swiftness

              <p className="my-4">
                <span className="text-gray-50 font-bold"> Stamina</span> – will
                determine your dog’s ability to participate in tournaments , if
                the stamina hits 0 your dog is not able to participate in any
                given tournament nor it can be trained, as it is simply
                exhausted
              </p>
              <p className="my-4">
                <span className="font-bold text-gray-100">Weight</span> –
                obviously will determine the weight of your dog.

              <p className="my-4">
                <span className="font-bold text-gray-100">Luck </span> – will be
                the most important, this will be the only trait you cannot
                improve, it will be inherited from doges parents. This stat will
                boost your doges chance of successful training , wining
                tournaments , and not getting injured during tournaments and
                competitions.

                  Houses, and Health Centers. Addition to these buildings there
                  will be Marketplace building , Utility Shops, Betting office,
                  and Arenas. Some other buildings will be added later down the
                  road. Every building in game will have two types. Public ones
                  and Private ones. Players will have free access to public
                  buildings, if there is free slots in them. Public buildings
                  however will ask a service cost from player for each action
                  they provide. Private ones will provide owners a way to breed,
                  train or heal their doges whenever they want, and with no
                  action price. However there will be a some sort of property
                  tax that will need to be payed in order to use a building.
